# Welcome! # 
My name is @CraigRegester!

I am Senior Solution Architect living in Indiana (USA), having focused my entire career thus far (23 years!) in the healthcare sector. I enjoy developing solutions that improves the care for patients and eases the burden on clinical team members.

## On a more personal note... ##
I am an avid learner, tinkerer and builder of creative solutions using novel multisystem integrations.

I have a passion for exploring, learning and attempting to become adept - usually with relatively decent success - at anything that sparks those creative juices.

I also enjoy sharing this passion and joy of learning and creative solution design with others through mentoring, idea exchanges, and code sharing. I am relatively new to the GitHub space but hope to use it more for this purpose in the future!
